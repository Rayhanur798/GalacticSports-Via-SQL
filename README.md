# SportsGalactic Database Design and Implementation (MySQL)

This project was part of a university coursework assignment for my Database Design and Implementation module. The brief was to design and build a database system for a fictional company called SportsGalactic — the galaxy’s first interplanetary sports gear retailer.

## Project Overview

The goal was to:
- Design a conceptual and logical ER diagram using UML notation
- Implement the database schema using MySQL (via phpMyAdmin)
- Populate tables with sample data
- Write and execute 10 SQL queries demonstrating different functionality

## What I Did

- Created an ERD to model relationships between customers, employees, orders, products, and departments
- Wrote SQL scripts to:
  - Create tables with appropriate keys
  - Insert sample data
  - Perform queries using joins, conditions, and aggregations
- Included screenshots of table creation and query results

## Tools Used

- MySQL / phpMyAdmin
- UML diagramming tools (e.g., Draw.io)
- SQL (DML and DDL)
- University-hosted phpMyAdmin server

## Disclaimer

This was an academic assignment during my first year at university. I only started learning SQL recently, so there may be some errors or areas that could be improved. However, I tried my best to understand and apply the concepts properly.

I'll likely improve the project in the future as I get more comfortable with database design and SQL best practices.

Thanks for taking a look!
